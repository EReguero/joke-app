# Joke App

## Getting Started

First, we need install Docker compose in our computer. [How install Docker compose?](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), if you never work with Docker i recommend Docker Desktop version.

When we have docker installed and running, we need execute the next command:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

After that app and database will be running.
